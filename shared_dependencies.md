The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components and manage the application's state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in `_document.tsx` and `_app.tsx` for rendering the application on the client side.

5. **CSS**: The `globals.css` file is used across the application for styling. It is imported in `_app.tsx`.

6. **Public assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the public directory are used across the application for displaying icons and logos.

7. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is used by all the files indirectly as it manages the packages they depend on.

8. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is used by all the TypeScript files (`index.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`) for setting up the TypeScript compiler options.

Note: As this is a basic setup, there are no specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names shared across the files. These would be defined based on the specific requirements of the application.
